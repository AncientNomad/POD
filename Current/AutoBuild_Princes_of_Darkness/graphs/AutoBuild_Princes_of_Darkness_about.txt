These are graph files of building trees, in the Graph Modeling Language (GML) format.

They were created to aid debugging, but were included for kicks.

They can be opened with several tools, such as the yED graph editor, though
note that they are not pre-arranged, and will have to be arranged after opening.
Editors such as yED can do this automatically.
