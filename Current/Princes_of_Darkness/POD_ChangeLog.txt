1230 War of Princes it the best bookmark.  The most work has been done on this bookmark as per the majority opinion from polling. 1355 is a shattered world based on 1230; it should mostly work.

Version 0.3.0 

After the release of Monks & Mystics, we decided to use new code options like scripted_effects and scripted_triggers. This meant a substantial rewrite of some code to make it more modular. Startup is faster.  Game play is faster thanks to on_action events and pre_triggers.
Vampires, mummies, prometheans and geists no longer get illness or disease.  We may add in some supernatural diseases for them in the future.
Added darker colormapp.dds from Darker Map mod.
Added back Caine and the Antediluvians to Masquerade bookmarks.
Added back Classic World of Darkness Dark Ages Vampire Characters.
Added back War of Princes 1230 Bookmark.
Title History work for War of Princes 1230 Bookmark.
Various code shenanigans to have AIs have dynasties other than "generic".
Changes Giovanni Empire shield to DAV20 design.
Disabled vanilla holy orders.
Disabled vanilla crusades.
Covenant (Holy) Wars are now called Jyhads.
Iconnu and Oradea League now pacifist.
Cappadocian dynasties.

Version 0.2.2.1

Big break happened.  I broke my arm.  Had to let that heal up, got distracted by life for awhile.   I've brought this mod up to the latest vanilla baseline for Monks & Mystics.  
Modified many traits to increase combat_skill instead of martial.   Vampires and werewolves are now beasts when it comes to duelling, but not as much Napolean.
Added localization clean up from EvilCatInTheHat
Added code cleanup by ngppgn.  I wanted to add the suggested changes of moving super initalization from on_actions, but what was built that way was too unstable for play.  Will revisit this possibility 
in the near future. 
Added decisions cleanup by ngppgn.
Modified bookmarks for shattered world scenarios.  Added bookmark art.



Version 0.2.1.2
Added vampire embrace mortal minor title again. Also decision to generate random vampire childe.  The embrace mortal title may be causing crashes from succession conflicts; so might the random childe.
So try either and see if one is better than the other.  For generating a random childe, I may set it so ages are always sequential. 
At the moment, mage trait is hereditary trait with a 25% chance.  In the future, I'd like to allow you to selected apprentices to awaken, designating an heir--but I'm word about succession related crashes.
Made Vampire: the Masquerade clans available in customizer.
Added supe_hunter and POD_vampire_RD_immortal_fix as opposites to various supernatural traits.
Removed cultures file to return to vanilla. 
Changed the 24 opposite trait references to assasmite to assamite.
Fixed religion_group and holy_order typo in POD_werewolf_merc_titles.
Earlier bookmarks such as 767 and 1250 seem less table than later bookmarks like 1466 or 1506.  I suspect the problem is conflict with vanilla events.  I have added some blank event files for CM and HL.  
The earlier bookmarks seem to be running more stably now.  If anyone knows particularly problematic events to be removed, let me know.


Version 0.2.1.1
hot fix for Mage.  Fixed POD_mage_commoner.2 and POD_CWOD_mage_commoner.2 so that game wouldn't get stuck with unclosable windows.
Added holy_sites for all mage religions to landed_titles.
Removed sphere_affinity_space from opposites in other spheres.  There is no space sphere in MtAs

Version 0.2.1

MAGES!  

Adds material for Mage: the Awakening and Mage: the Ascension
Spheres, Arcanum, Sphere Affinity, Diamond Orders, Seers of the Throne Pyramid, Order of Reason, Daedalans, Council of Nine Magical Traditions, Nephandi, Scelesti, Timori, Pharmakons and more.
Add three new bookmarks: Pax Hermetica 767 CD Mage: the Ascension, Sorcerer's Crusade 1466 CE and De Occult Philosophia 1533 Mage: the Awakening.  All bookmarks are currently shattered worlds.
Mages will also start appearing in other bookmarks as commoners, just as other supernaturals will appear in Mage bookmarks as commoners.
After initial setup, new mages are created by inheriting the mage trait. 

Fixed issue with new World of Darkness bookmarks not spawning supernatural or mortal traits for commoners
Returned troop sizes to vanilla for now and returned vanilla buildings.  Took out the smaller size unit armies because AI was not sieging holdings or even moving during war.
edited health event to include arcanum/sphere for life and death immortals

Version 0.2

Compatible with CK2 Version 2.4.2
Compatible with all DLC including Way of Life, Charlemagne and Horse Lords
No DLC required

Had to make many changes to get things working after Way of Life.  
For now, AI vampires spawn a random character to embrace, rather than choosing a spouse or councillor.   I may revisit this for the AI later. 
Player vampires still get to chose their childer. 
Speculation is that set_mother/set_father/dynasty commands on pre-existing characters was causing crash at save.  
Rewrote training vampire disciplines and werewolf gifts.  This removed ngpgn's training disciplines for now.  It will probably return with cleaner spacing.  
For now, AI are not deciding on raising disciplines/gifts.  In the future, AI will get a different set of events to manage discipline/gift/etc... growth; perhaps even an annual check.
Removed all previous versions custom /history/titles /history/provinces and /history/characters--more than 6000 files; 
Baseline of cleared characters from Kingdoms Abound Titular Generator was causing crash. 
Changed vampire prisoner decisions to targetted decisions that provide a timed character modifier upon draining.  Different modifiers for every different supernatural type drained.
Removed vitae code for now. 
Created new storyteller scripts that change province religion based on bookmark.
Adapted CK2Plus shattered world decision for a bookmark event for 1250 NWOD shattered world bookmark.
Added abdication of child rulers.
Added Weihan Cynn and Fuil-Beannaithe vampire covenants for Saxon/English and Celtic pagans respectively.
Added supernatural government types.  
Corrected spellings of Setite and Inconnu. 
Revised conversion script to limit conversions to supernatural specific religions per supernatural type; and also limit clans to join their particular Camarilla clan faction when joining the Camarilla.  
I need to add an event that changes antitribu trait on conversion.
Removed custom red vampire character GUI.  
Modified religion icon strip and edited covenants appropriately.
Updated defines.lua

Known issues:
Much localization needs to be done.
In Vampire: The Masquerade diablerie, blood potency does improve, but generation improvement is not in the code yet.
Norway likes to remain Catholic, the South Caspian area likes to remain Shia/Sunni.   
Feudal government tends to reemerge over time, even though I have an event to stomp it out.  
The King of Norway gives up their crown, but his counties don't split up to individual counts in the broken world scenarios.


Version 0.1.7

Compatible with CK2 Version 2.2

Added "Storyteller" Character with id=9999999 for different game mechanics at different bookmarks (traits: bookmark232, bookmark412, bookmark1142, bookmark1230, bookmark1250, bookmark1500).  
Storyteller is immortal, immune to disease and immune to plots. Emperor of Storytelling.  Landless. Unknown Location.
Added storyteller event that removes characters from inappropriate bookmarks (it works by killing off the characters from the wrong bookmark)

Removed "Demand Religious Conversion" through editing defines.lua.  Modified Lord Spiritual Job and conversion decisions to restrict conversions to type.
Werewolves should usually only convert to werewolf tribe, Vampires should usually only convert to vampire covenants, etc...

Removed Province Cultural Conversions.

Added War of Princess 1230 Bookmark for development by ngppgn.  This is a Dark Ages: Vampire (Vampire the Masquerade/old World of Darkness) book mark.  
Divided up the religion file by supernatural type to make maintenance and expansion easier.
Reduced cost of Controlled buildings/influence.
Adjusted starting influence/technology levels, and with it starting buildings. 

Character Info screen redesigned by ngppgn to allow more space for traits, fixed placement of objectives and plots.  
Modified GUI (red tint) for Character Info, Dynasty tree, religious patriarchs, etc... 

Massive code cleanup by ngppgn
Finally exorcised the insiduous parsing errors in disciplines and gifts decisions. See comments on those files for more information.
Simplified allow clauses in vampire disciplines decisions.
Removed redundant conditions and commands in both vampires and werewolf training decision (the same condition need not be in both allow and potential, 
it two traits are opposites, adding one removes the other without needing a remove_trait command

The player will now have a toggleable "decision menu" for training decision, to reduce crowdedness in decisions tab
Number of Maximum Leadership Traits increased to 10 

Vampire:

Added Vampire: the Masquerade/Dark Ages: Vampire clans, disciplines and covenants as well as expanding on a 1230 CE War of Princes (DAV) bookmark
Added Vampire: the Masquerade covenants from a 1505 CE Convention of Thorns (Camarilla vs. Sabbat) bookmark.

Gained permission from Enlil to make use of 480 Migration mod common/cultures and history/provinces file for later fleshing out the Requiem for Rome bookmark.
Future development of Requiem for Rome bookmark will await release of the 480 Migration mod, which in turn is awaiting the release of the patch which accompanies the Charlemagne DLC. 

Added vitae code by ngppgn.   Unfortunately, the vitae events had to be removed as they were broken with 2.2

Most empires have some degree of centralization.  Most empires have some variant of elective (a few have seniority or tanis).  There is a new holder maintenance event which will cause a titular empire to be destroyed if held by the wrong supernatural type, religion or culture. 

Note: in the 1142 bookmark, the recommended characters are largely the only playable characters.  If you want to play a duke or count, select the 1250 bookmark; or start up at 1142, let the game run a few turns, save game, load save game and pick anywhere on the map.

Geography: 
Set all cultures to not use dynasty names for primary title.   If you want to see dynasties, there is a map tab for that! 
Made Hungary have Hungarian characters.  Moved some Pencheng to former Hungarian territory, north of the Black Sea.  Decreased Avar characters.  All of dejure Wallachia is now Vlach and Circle of the Crone. Increased Invictus and Circle of the Crone vampires in Hungary, reduced Fire-Touched Werewolves. Added Hungarians to Ungvar, removed Croats. Removed some Bohemians for more Hungarians.
Add Seljuk/Turkish migration to Anatolia.  Adjusted religion, culture accordingly.  Lancea Sanctum now dominates the crusader states, while al-Amin and Ivory Claws followed the Turkish invasion. There is some character work left to do so that we don't have Greek al-Amin.
All Norse Storm Lords replaced with Norse Blood Talons.  Dutch Lancea Sanctum replaced with Dutch Iron Masters. Blood Talons, Storm Lords in Scotland and Ireland replaced with Bale Hounds.
Created 5 holy sites for every religion to address 2.1.6 bug (too differentiate holy sites later).
If supernaturals convert to "innocent", they will subsequently become unaligned or ghost wolves.  Werewolves should no longer be converted by liege to vampire religion and vampires should no longer be converted by liege to werewolf religion.

Vampires:

Forsworn/Belial's Brood: now a significant Covenant.  Actually exists as religion group with various factions (Nameless, Mercy Seat, Roaring Serpent, Throne of Smokeness Fire, Pandaemonium) as religons.  Djinn has been eliminated a separately religion, with holdings distributed to Smokeless Throne and Unaligned.
Increased county holding substantially. They are smaller than Lancea Sanctum or Invictus, about the size of the Circle of the Crone, al-Amin, Ivory Claws, Mara-Dharma--they are spread over a wide geographic area.  
Forsworn unholy orders: The Hidden, Archons, Antinomians, Faustians, Djinn, and the Hyletics.  Forsworn mercenaries: the Black Hand, Manus Nigrum, Talmahera, Baali, and the Sabbat.
Therion dynasty will appear for some Forswon.
Forsworn also have their own revenant families who are hireable as mercenaries and have ancesteral county holdings, the Duolosi: Androphonis, Anleemoni, Avigsonne, Carcassonne, D'habi, Diakonos, and Schiavari.

Revenants/Ghoul Families:  Added all named revenant families from OWOD and NWOD.  They exist as hireable mercenaries, dynasties, an as well as often claiming single counties for their ancesteral homelands.  
The families: Asmundarson, Basarab, Bratovitch, Crassus, Cult of Nirriti, Danislaw, Enrathi, Grimaldi, Khazi, Krevcheski, Marijava, Narov, Obertus, Oprichniki, Premysl, Rafastio, Rustovitch, Ruthvenski, Szantovich (Zanatosa) and Vlaszy

Mercenaries: Some clan specific mercenaries added: The Carnival (Daeva), Larvae (Gangrel), Angustri (Mekhet), Noctuku (Nosferatu), and the Last State (Ventrue)
Added some Ashirra/Islamic/Arabic mercenaries: Assamites, Ashirra, Banu Haqim, Bay't Majnoon, Bay't Muirim, Bay't Mushakis, Bay't Mutasharid, Qabilat al-Khayal, Qabilat al-Mawt, Ray'een al-Fen, Wah'Sheenand the Walid Set.
Added some Dark Age Inquisitor supernatural hunter mercenaries: House Murnau, Oculi Dei, Sisters of Saint John, The Red Order and the Order of the Poor Knights of the Passion of the Cross of Acre

Rebels: Rebel Dukes now are supernatural as appropriate; as are their courtiers.

Sped up Technology/Influence Level Increase

WRONG_GOV_FORM_TAX_MOD = 0

Massive building overhaul: 

Bribed (Level 1):  First stage of controlling a resource.  Quick and cheap to do with small reward.  1 week, 10 gold.  +1 light_infantry
Influenced (Level 2): Second stage of controlling a resource.  Moderate time, moderate cost with moderate reward.  1 month, 50 gold. +10 light_infantry
Controlled (Level 3): Third stage of controlling a resource.  Large time, large cost with large reward.  1 year, 500 gold. +100 light_infantry
Ghouled (Level 1.G): For vampires only and costs province blood. Quick and cheap to do with large reward.  1 week, 10 gold, +100 light_infantry.  But costs 1 province blood every month, and has a trigger of a high provnice blood to do.
Conditioned (Level 2.C): For vampires with Dominate IV.  Large time, moderate cost with a large reward.  6 months, 250 gold. +75 light_infantry.  This will give Ventrue a subsantial edge over other vampires in influencing society.
Not all building/influence will have these options and paths; but most will.

Bribed Whore (Level 1)
Influenced Pimp (Level 2)
Controlled Brothel (Level 3)
Ghouled Madam (Level 1.G)

Version 0.1.5

* * * Please be sure do delete your existing Princes_of_Darkness cache files if any (probably located at C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\Documents\Paradox Interactive\Crusader Kings II\Princes of Darkness * * *
Casus Belli Holy War restricted: nominal piety cost, many different traits will allow for holy war.
Also, you may find that a baron has an independent barony in your county that you will have a county claim upon that you can wage war and then grant to a more worthy vassal.
The levy and garrison sizes of castles, temples, cities, holy orders and mercenaries has been greatly reduced. Costs have been increased. Supernaturals of Princes of Darkness command very few mortals, but in the future will have powerful special unit retinues.  Adventure unit spawns have also been nerfed.  Combat should be short and sharp!  Balance suggestions welcome!
Changed units: Light Infantry = Cut-Throats.  Hireable only as retinues: Archers = Witch Hunters, Pikemen = Mages.  This might changed based on play feedback. In the future, Merc/Holy Orders may have Special Troops.  
Technology levelled to zero at start for all. 
Modifed technology localisation: advances now influences, also individual techs being renamed (Criminal Underworld, Darkened Mortals, Supernaturals, Smuggling, Masons, Elysium, Renonwn, Legitmacy, etc...).  "Technology" will become Influence and represent a supernatural's domain influence over supernatural and mortal society; not the ability of your Sheriff to design a better catapult. Vampires in particular lag behind technological trends, but they are vastly powerful when it comes to influence. 
Mercenary hire distance reduced.
Buildings have been greatly reduced.  More buildings to come in the future that more fitting with the theme.
Fixed bug with event/lorspiritual_job causing unhidden window spams.
Modified all covenants so that lords can_holtemples = yes
Removed tax penalty for wrong government type from defines.lua.  Hold castles, temples or cities without tax penalty.
Fixed issue with failed Coat of Arms for random COAs.  Expect improved colors for random COAs.  In the future, expect custom graphics for random COAs, grouped by Religion/Covenant.

Vampire:
	New Casus Belli: Clan War.  Can only be used against independent lords who do not share your clan, but do share your religion group and culture.
	Fixed misplaced } with vampire prisoner diablerie decision.  Vampires will not go automatically to blood potency X upon diablorizing any vampire.
	Changed monthly piety gain to 1 for cruac 5, theban 5 and coils 5.
	Fixed FLAG_PORECENT_VAMPIRE_CHILDE reference in vampire_embrace_vassal_decisions to decrease embrace rate
	Added Dammitic Creed to Deir (Nehardea).  Perhaps make more Dammitic baronies in the future.
	Increased Banu Shaitan at the expense of Al-Amin
	Special buildings: Nosfeartu Warrens, Hellhound Kennels (Animalism), Elysium (Longinus and Abrahamic groups)
	VII (The Betrayed) are now a trait rather than a covenant/religion. VII vampires will now be randomnly generated; with appropriate clan and culture combinations.  They can also earn nicknames. They'll be hunting you. They can not use Casus Belli Clan War.
	Gorgon dynasties (Euryale/Stheno) now start as Circle of the Crone with Cruac instead of Theban as appropriate.
	Fixed Rule Designer Vampire Immortality issue.
	Retinue: Ghoul (Heavy Infantry), Vampire (Knight)
	Changed ratio of Independent Dynasties to Bloodline Dynasties to 50/50 on random landed characters at startup (ratio was 35/65).  This should reduce the power of landed dynasties, yet still have them appear in cultures with few holdings. 

Werewolf:
	Moved Bone Shadows to North Africa, at the expense of Banu Shaitan, Al-Amin and Ascending Ones
	Moved Hunters in Darkness to Arabia, at the expense of Al-Amin, Ascending Ones and Banu Shaitan
	Increased Storm Lord presence in Slavic Europe, at the expense of Hunters in Darkness and Bone Shadows
	Fixed issue with location reverse_religion which was causing most noble werewolves to be ghost wolves.  Now, they usually keep their default province religion.
	Retinue: Werewolf (Light Cavalry)
