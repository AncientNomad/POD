BM_WAR_OF_PRINCES_INFO;The War of Princes is the period of conflict in Cainite history that began shortly after the fall of Constantinople to the Fourth Crusade in 1204. The term refers to the conflicts over territory that the various princes of Europe fought after the end of the Long Night. The War of Princes began shortly before the Inquisition was formed. Although the Inquisitors were initially used as tools by the elders, they soon became a greater threat to the Cainites than the Cainites were to one another. Although it is not clear exactly when the War of Princes ended, it would have likely been forced to a conclusion with the advent of the Anarch Revolt, if not sooner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
