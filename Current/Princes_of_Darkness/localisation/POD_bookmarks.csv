ERA_CHAR_INFO_505053;Count Vladimir Rustovich was one of the greatest Voivodes of Transylvanian history, and a legendary enemy of the Shadow Lords. Formerly a Bratovitch revenant, Vladimir assumed both the mantle of Cainite, the title of Voivode and his sires estate through diligence, might, and a modicum of treachery. He became renown even during his mortal days fighting numerous battles against the many enemies of his Clan - and after his sire fell in battle against the native werewolves, Vladimir led the campaign against both his rivals and the culprit Garou.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Embraced by the Lasombra Antediluvian before the birth of Christ, he became a favored childe of the Antediluvian since that time. As time wore on, Lasombra needed a fixed location to go into torpor. Sicily was the perfect place, far removed from Italy's wars and the Ventrue-dominated Holy Roman Empire.

ERA_CHAR_INFO_505085;Guillaume is the Inconnu Prince of Switzerland and, by extension, Liechtenstein. He is rumored to be one of the few vampires to have attained the state of Golconda.  Guillaume's youth was shaped by violence and his achievement of Golconda was more of a resignation into the meaninglessness of his actions that resulted in a pragmatic calm. A high voice among the Inconnu, Guillaume makes his residence in Geneva, where he discusses international matters with other high-ranking members of the sect.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

He ruled over the Fiefs of the Black Cross within the boundaries of the Holy Roman Empire. This Ventrue was one of the harshest rulers of the Dark Medieval world, enforcing the Sixth Tradition under the threat of Final Death. As a member of the Camarilla Inner Circle, he is thought to be the leader of the entire organization. In the 15th century, Hardestadt, along with several other Camarilla vampires, held stock in the Muscovy Company, which smuggled vampires across the Atlantic into the New World. Hardestadt used this method to get rid of the marauding Sabbat packs in Europe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ERA_CHAR_INFO_605104;Rafael de Corazon is one of the founders of the Camarilla and the most fervent defender of the Masquerade. As the situation of the Burning Times had grown dire, De Corazon used his sire's authority to address the elders directly during the first meetings. Reminding them of the Sixth Tradition (the Masquerade), that they had so often breached, he accused them of being responsible for the current situation: "Living openly among mortals has been our ruin! We violated the spirit of the Sixth Tradition, and we pay for it in blood! Mortals are too numerous and too jealous of our power. They will try to destroy us as long as they know of us. It has always been so. We must turn our backs on them. We must hide our faces away from their envious eyes.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ERA_CHAR_INFO_605106;A master manipulator, Fanchon understands speech and its uses far better than any of the other Founders, that blustering fool Hardestadt included. Strong willed and thaumaturgically talented, she seeks to disarm opponents by confusing them, commanding verbal trickery and a rapier wit. She prefers to be in control during any situation. She proposed that the unruly anarchs be blood bound both to their immediate sires and Clan Tremere as the price of their readmission to Cainite society, so that she and her clanmates may keep a close eye on them. Around the 17th century, Fanchon became obsessed with the Sargon Fragment, an obscure text promising Apotheosis that was searched for by the powerful necromancer Ambrogino Giovanni. She is one of the few occultists to have relearned Chaldean.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ERA_CHAR_INFO_605108;During the Convention of Thorns, Camilla was one of those who supported the notion of the Camarilla and the inclusion of the Malkavians. Her part in the ritual that cut off Dementation from her Clan is unknown, but she was not among the Methuselahs that actually managed the feat. She supported Hardestadt during the creation of the Camarilla and acted as the first Justicar of Clan Malkavian. She suffered from a split personality that manifested in a gentle and caring, as well as a vicious and brutal personality. Not much is known about her, but she was prone to strange visions and impressions that both frightened and delighted her. She felt the incoming destruction of both Japheth and Augustus usurpation of Clan Cappadocian coming, as well as the minor Maelstrom that would erupt within the shadowlands as a result.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ERA_CHAR_INFO_605109;Sofia is the First Regent of the Sabbat.  In the Sabbat there is only one Regent at a time, and while she does not have absolute authority, her directives are usually carried out. According to Sabbat doctrine, however, the Regent is merely overseeing the sons and daughters of Caine until the Dark Father returns to lead his children himself. The Regent is the president, so to speak, of this vampire sect, and each of the Archbishops or councils of Bishops is ultimately accountable to this authority. At the start of Sabbat, the Regent was a dominant leader of clan Lasomba--and their demense was based in Spain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

BM_WAR_OF_PRINCES_INFO;The War of Princes is the period of conflict in Cainite history that began shortly after the fall of Constantinople to the Fourth Crusade in 1204. The term refers to the conflicts over territory that the various princes of Europe fought after the end of the Long Night. The War of Princes began shortly before the Inquisition was formed. Although the Inquisitors were initially used as tools by the elders, they soon became a greater threat to the Cainites than the Cainites were to one another. Although it is not clear exactly when the War of Princes ended, it would have likely been forced to a conclusion with the advent of the Anarch Revolt, if not sooner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The Convention of Thorns was a peace agreement between leaders of the Camarilla, the Anarchs and the Assamite clan made on October 23, 1493. It marked the end of open conflict between the three groups, and more specifically an end to the first Anarch Revolt.  The Convention places equal responsibility on all three groups for maintaining the peace, but is seen by most Anarchs as a disaster. It specified that while no Anarchs would face reprisals for their actions (except for the especially heinous, which would be considered by the Justicars within a year or forgotten), they would have to return to their clans and sires, reestablishing the status quo they had rebelled against. Anarchs of the Lasombra and Tzimisce clans did not accept the Convention, however, and went on to form the Sabbata.
