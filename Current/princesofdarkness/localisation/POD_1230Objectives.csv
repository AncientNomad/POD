EVTDESCPOD_VAMPIRE_1230_OBJECTIVES1;As the night dawns on Europe, some things will never change. The Lasombra will plot, the Nosferatu will lurk in the shadows, the Toreador will fawn on pretty baubles… Mortals will carry on theirs insignificants lives, unaware of the much larger game played when the sky darken. This will never change. New ideas will spring, new religions, new theories, a whole new world maybe. But vampires don’t care. They never change. But, this night, every undead sense that something has changed for the first time in centuries. As they look, like mortals do, to the holiest of city, they can’t deny that a new era has begun, with a simple change. Ventrue are not mere Kings of the undead. Ventrue are Emperors.

EVTNAMEPOD1230OBJ.3;The Midnight Crescent;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCPOD1230OBJ.3;From the walls of Constantinople to the Castel d’Ombro, the Faqih surveys his empire and wonders ‘Are my people safe?’. As the last battle concludes in a victory, the Faqih thinks ‘How do I avoid more bloodshed?’. When all of the Ashirra look to him for guidance, protection and counsel, the Faqih is not proud, he is humbled. As he dons his new regalia, worthy of an Eternal Caliph, the Faqih thinks of the future, of the best ways to make sure that the faithful cainites will be safe, forever. And when the last of the kuffar Lasombra is brought to his feet, the Faqih asks ‘Will you choose the Crescent… or the Sun?’.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAPOD1230OBJ.3;Is this a beginning or an end?;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTTOOLTIPPOD1230OBJ.6;Your place in the night is finally secure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAMEPOD1230OBJ.6;The Will of Tremere;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCPOD1230OBJ.6;As you kneel before him, you can feel the envy of all the clan. Tremere do not wake for just anyone. You are not just anyone, anymore. Before you, the clan was threatened. Its place in the night was tenuous at best. Now? The fiends are a sad joke, alone in their crumbling castles. Those devious infernalists, the soul stealers are destroyed. All of the European kindred thank you for your crushing of their last holdouts. The Tremere clan is well on its way to its rightful destiny of becoming masters of the night. As you stand before him, Tremere simply says 'You did well.' For the first time, Tremere will have a voice for his will, someone he trusts enough to be lord of the Inner Circle. You.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCPOD1230OBJ.8;‘Once, you were blind to the beauty of Set. You called yourselves Cainites, for a false progenitor tricked you into worshipping him. Now, you know better, only a God should be worshipped. A merciful God, because He will forgive your past transgressions against Him, but also a vengeful God for this night forward, the last Cainites will be branded enemies of Set and converted, or brought before Ra’s unflinching eye. There will be no respite until all of Europe praises His glorious name, then, and only then, will He bless us with His return! … Come, children, let us pray in the temple for the coming of this glorious time. Then, enjoy the rewards of your wise choice, for the night is still young…’;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCPOD1230OBJ.11;‘They said that the death of Narses, our first Archbishop, was to be our end. We endured. They said that the murder of the pious bishop St-Lys by the heathen Anatole was just. We didn’t forget. They said that our religion was an abomination, a parody of the traditions of Caine. We stood tall in our belief of the Third Caine and the cruelty of the Demiurge. They said that we would soon be a bad memory, a remnant of a forgotten age. We are stronger than ever. They said that the mortal Church and its Inquisition will finish us. We stand proudly in the Holy City, and agents of the hated Church of Pilate cower before us… Now ? They say nothing, and they pray with us.’;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAMEPOD1230OBJ.14;A Heavy Burden;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCPOD1230OBJ.14;The sword feels heavy in your hand. You found it while exploring the ruins of the utopia you fought so hard for, Carthage. But you are no youngling, you know all too well that every myth is a complex amalgam of lies and truths. An entire clan looks upon you and wonder, will you claim the mantle of Troile and bring upon a new Golden Age for vampires? This choice will make you many new enemies, and you know that even Troile had failed to safeguard Carthage against corruptive influence. Or will you claim Carthage as a political tool, refusing its mixed legacy? This move will earn you the respect of many other clans, but you will then be no better than the Ventrue. The sword of Troile that you cling to is a powerful symbol of this hard choice. Will you… ?    ;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCPOD1230OBJ.17;They come bearing gifts. Powerful cainites from all Europe, eager to see the new ruler of Constantinople. As they enter your richly decorated throne room, you ask yourself how many will have propositions, threats or daggers waiting for you before the end of the night. You also idly wonder, was this Michael plan all along? Did he knew that his Dream required a change of leadership, a fresh vision? You will probably never know.  What you do know though is that your illustrious guests all want to learn something tonight and their gifts are a part of this scheme. Michael, self proclaimed Archangel, would have refused such worldly offerings or even be offended by them. If you refuse as well, you will be truly Michael’s Heir. But perhaps the Dream needs to take a new path under your leadership, and you can make the first move right now. Will you…?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
