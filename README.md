Princes of Darkness Crusader Kings II (CK2) Modification

The Dark Ages just got a whole lot darker. Play Crusader Kings 2 as an immortal vampire, a savage werewolf or more! Not some fledgling bloodsucker or young cub though--you are a master of a realm, the lord of a supernatural domain, Prince of the city! Ghoul your courtiers, embrace new vampires to forge a dynasty and try to live forever!

This mod is inspired by Vampire: the Requiem, Vampire: the Masquerade, Dark Ages: Vampire, etc...
